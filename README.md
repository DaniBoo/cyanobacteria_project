Looked into using BioRuby but it seemed a little overcomplicated for our needs. Also the exmaples in the documentation didn't work. Therefore decided to reject BioRuby for now.

Decided to use Rspec on recommendation.

Working on new computer (Macbook Air). So will need to set up everything from scratch. This should help with portability of app as it's a good opportunity to have this all documented.

Am using Submlime Text 2 for text editing and ghe Github mac client for version control.

Going to look at using Bundler and a Gemfile in order to manage dependencies on recommendation.

Have been recommended to look at using Heroku. This makes it easy to run Ruby applications in the cloud (Ubuntu VM running on Amazon Web Services) and is low-cost / free.

1. Added CodeML binary manually in the /bin directory.

2. Installed RVM to upgrade to Ruby 1.9.3 and manage Ruby versions.
Following instructions here:

#### To do:

- Install Bundler
- Create a Gemfile for package (gem) dependencies.
