=====================

Ruby code for University of St. Andrews Biology honours project.

By Danielle Boobyer.

Notes:

Looked into using BioRuby but it seemed a little overcomplicated for our needs. Also the exmaples in the documentation didn't work. Therefore decided to reject BioRuby for now.

Decided to use Rspec on recommendation.
